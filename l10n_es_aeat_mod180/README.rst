Installation
============

.. raw:: html

   <!--
       Audience: system administrators.

       Purpose: help them provide this module's technical requirements.

       ⚠️ Cautions:

       - DO NOT specify Python or Odoo dependencies. These are specified in
         ../__manifest__.py and Odoo will raise an error automatically with a
         specific message if one of these is missing.

       ⛔ REMOVE THIS FILE if there are no special installation instructions.
   -->

To install this module, you need to:

1. Do this ...

Configuration
=============

.. raw:: html

   <!--
       Audience: users that will configure Odoo to make this module work.

       Purpose: help them configure Odoo appropriately.

       ⚠️ Cautions:

       - Do not assume the user knows how to find the menus. Guide them there.

       ⛔ REMOVE THIS FILE if the module works out of the box and there is nothing to configure.

Usage
=====

.. raw:: html

   <!--
       Audience: end users, functional reviewers.

       Purpose: help them use this module.

       ⚠️ Cautions:

       - Required section.

       - This section implies that somebody (maybe another user with more privileges)
         already followed any instructions in ./CONFIGURE.rst.

       - Guide the user, step by step, to see the module effect in Odoo.

       - DO NOT ASSUME that the user knows where to find stuff or technical terms.

         Bad example:
         #. Create a new partner.

         Good example:
         #. Go to the "Contacts" app.
         #. Create a new contact.

       - IT MUST NOT contain reStructuredText sections, only body text (paragraphs, lists,
         tables, etc).

         If you need a more elaborate structure to explain the addon, please create a
         Sphinx documentation (which may include this file as a "quick start" section).

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

.. raw:: html

   <!--
       Audience: end users, contributors, maintainers.

       Purpose: let them know limitations or potential future improvements.

       ⚠️ Cautions:

       - Enumerate known caveats and future potential improvements.
       - Help potential new contributors discover new features to implement.

       ⛔ REMOVE THIS FILE if the module is feature-complete or has no known issues.

Changelog
=========

.. raw:: html

   <!--
       Audience: Odoo users and integrators.

       Purpose: help them know what changed in this module over time.

       ⚠️ Cautions:

       - DO NOT include purely technical changes such as code refactoring.
       - This file may contain ONE level of section titles, underlined
         with the ~ (tilde) character. Other section markers are
         forbidden and will likely break the structure of the README.rst
         or other documents where this fragment is included.

       ⛔ REMOVE THIS FILE if you won't maintain this file updated. It is better to
       have no changelog than to have it unmaintained. In such case, you probably
       want to remove ./newsfragments/ too.
